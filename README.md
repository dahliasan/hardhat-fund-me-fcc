# Hardhat Fund Me â€“ FreeCodeCamp

This is me learning solidity from Patrick Collin's FreeCodeCamp solidity course!

Check out the deployed [demo contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x5E59d24ac78930f5D05dAc4264FB978Fe0f0cDC8) on the Rinkeby testnet.

## What I've learnt

- writing smart contracts
- hardhat.js
- ethers.js
- unit and staging testing
- deploying to localhost and testnet
- deploying mocks
- verifying contracts manually and automatically using scripts
- `.env` security
- running scripts to easily fund and withdraw from my contracts
- gas optimisations
